# IDS-IOT-ML
DESIGN OF AN INTRUSION DETECTION MODEL FOR IOT-ENABLED SMART HOME USING LGBM CLASSIFIER

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), security
has become a paramount concern due to the increasing number of
devices communicating with each other using different protocols.
However, these devices often lack the processing power to ensure
safety, necessitating a significant improvement in our current
methods of protecting IoT networks. Machine learning (ML)
has emerged as a promising solution for securing IoT systems.
This project presents the design of an intrusion detection model
for IoT-enabled smart homes, leveraging machine learning to
enhance security. The project employs a range of ML classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Random
Forest (RF), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). These algorithms are used
both individually and in ensemble to classify and predict various
types of network attacks. The [DS2OS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/libamariyam/ds2os-dataset)
, which includes
’normal’ and ’anomalous’ network traffic, is used for this study.
The performance of the classifiers was evaluated based on the
accuracy, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), runtime,
and confusion matrix. The LGBM ensemble classifier was found
to have better performance. The proposed intrusion detection
model, ”LGB-IDS,” was validated using ensemble techniques,
such as majority voting. The main objective of this project is to
propose the design of an efficient intrusion detection model with
high accuracy, better time efficiency, and a reduced false alarm
rate. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 99.5% and
has a time efficiency that is much higher than those of other
prevalent algorithm-based models.
